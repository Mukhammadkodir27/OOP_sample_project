# OOP Projects in Python

Welcome to the OOP Projects in Python repository! This is where I work on various projects using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. Each project demonstrates the power and flexibility of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Whether you're new to OOP or looking to deepen your understanding, this repository provides a collection of projects to explore and learn from.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. Each project is designed to showcase different aspects of OOP, from simple examples to more complex applications. By studying and experimenting with these projects, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to design and implement OOP-based solutions.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects available in this repository:

- **Library Management System**:
  - A system for managing books, patrons, and library transactions using OOP concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.

- **Banking System**:
  - A banking application that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history using OOP principles.

- **Online Shopping Platform**:
  - An online shopping platform where users can browse products, add them to cart, and checkout, demonstrating OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction.
